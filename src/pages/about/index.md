 I take this opportunity to introduce myself as an electrical engineer, management graduate and a professional with rich experience in ***"vertical transportation industry".***

Living and working across vibrant cities in **India**, **Singapore** and **Dubai** has afforded me hands-on knowledge and expertise in diverse global, regional and emerging markets. I adapt quickly and effectively to new environments and cultures. Working with regionally / globally dispersed multi-functional teams have acquired substantial technical knowledge, management and interpersonal skills.  My key skills include Project Management and Operations, Sales & service of capital equipment, business planning & development, key Account Management and customer Relationship Management.

I have been working in US (based in New York), since October 2015 and am looking forward to accepting new challenges and utilize experience gained during my 28 years of successful international career for the further growth of the reputed organization.
